# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Using an openweathermaps.org API, moment.js, and Javascript, this application allows the user to see the current weather in any city, along with the forecast for the next 5 days.

The user will enter a city name in the search box, and once the search button is clicked the forecast will appear on the page.

You can preview the application in the screenshot provided below, or you can visit the live website here:
